# 🌳 C4.5 Decision Tree Algorithm

This repository provides an overview of the **C4.5 algorithm**, one of the most well-known decision tree classification algorithms developed by **Ross Quinlan**. C4.5 is widely used in data mining and machine learning for building interpretable models.

## 📘 What is C4.5?

**C4.5** is a supervised learning algorithm that builds **decision trees** from labeled training data using a **top-down, recursive divide-and-conquer approach**.

It is an improvement over the earlier **ID3** algorithm, offering enhanced functionality such as handling continuous attributes, missing values, and tree pruning.

| 🌳 Model Output         | Decision Tree                                                              |
| 📈 Splitting Criterion  | Gain Ratio (Improves on ID3's Information Gain)                            |
| 📉 Handles Continuous   | ✅ Yes – Automatically selects best thresholds for splits                   |
| ❓ Handles Missing Data | ✅ Yes                                                                      |
| ✂️ Pruning              | ✅ Yes – Performs **post-pruning** to avoid overfitting                     |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **At each node**, compute the **gain ratio** of all available features.
2. **Choose the best feature** with the highest gain ratio to split the data.
3. Recursively apply the above steps to create subtrees.
4. **Stop** when all instances at a node have the same class or when stopping criteria are met.
5. **Post-prune** the resulting tree to improve generalization.

## 📊 Gain Ratio

\[
\text{Gain Ratio} = \frac{\text{Information Gain}}{\text{Intrinsic Information}}
\]

This helps reduce bias toward attributes with many distinct values.

## 🛠 Tools and Implementations

- **Weka**: Implements C4.5 as `J48`.
- **Scikit-learn**: Doesn’t implement C4.5 exactly, but you can build similar models with `DecisionTreeClassifier`.
- **Python Libraries**: Custom implementations of C4.5 are available in some GitHub repositories for learning purposes.
